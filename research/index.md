"For just as the Milky Way is the universe in the form of a flower, we are the universe in the form of a human. And every time we are drawn to look up in the night sky and reflect on the awesome beauty of the universe, we are actually the universe reflecting on itself. And this changes everything." â€” Brian Thomas Swimme & Mary Evelyn Tucker, Journey of the Universe
