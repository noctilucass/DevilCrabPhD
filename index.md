# The Devil Crab PhD

Coastal marine ectotherms live in a world of shifting oxygen, temperature, and pHâ€”often predictable, sometimes stochastic. Yet most studies overlook how organisms sense and respond to these fluctuations. My research explores how oxygen predictability shapes the plasticity and resilience of a keystone species: Necora puber.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Natural and anthropogenic-induced changes in sea surface temperature (SST) affect all marine organisms, including the critical larval stages of coastal invertebrate species. Changes in sea surface temperature affect larval stages that must respond to these changes behaviourally, physiologically and, in some cases, alter morphological traits. Here, we evaluated the effects of rearing temperature on starvation-survival, swimming performance and morphology of zoea 1 larvae of the kelp crab (Taliepus dentatus).
